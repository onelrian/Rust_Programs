## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Rust**: If you don't have Rust installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

   After installation, verify it by running:

   ```bash
   rustc --version
   ```

2. **Git**: Ensure you have Git installed to clone the repository. You can download it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

   Verify Git installation:

   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onelrian/Rust_Programs.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username or the appropriate repository URL.

After cloning, navigate to the repository directory:

```bash

## Running the Examples

Each Rust file in the `src/` directory is a standalone example. To run a specific example, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin <filename_without_extension>
```

For example, to run the `hello_world.rs` example:

```bash
cargo run --bin hello_world
```

This will compile and execute the code, displaying the output in your terminal.
